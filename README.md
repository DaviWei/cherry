# Cherry

``Cherry`` is a ``webchat engine`` wrote in ``Golang``. It brings the main functionalities that you need in a webchat server.

With this application you are able to serve a bunch of rooms from your machine just editing a configuration file in a specific language.
So if you are interested you should read the [documentation](https://github.com/rafael-santiago/cherry/blob/master/doc/README.md) to learn how to master it.

Until now ``SSL connections`` are unsupported.
